print 17/2
print 17/2.0
#print float(17/2) This will output 8.0 meaning that first 17/2 is computed as 8 and then conv to float as 8.0
#print 17/float(2) this prints out 8.5 since python converts 2 to a float type and then performs division.
#print int(17/2.0) THis rounds down the result of the decimal division.
print 12.0/3
print 1+2*5
#one could also write the program by using the variables given
#width=17
#height=12.0
#print width/2
#print width/2.0
#print float (width/2)
#print width/float(2)
#print int(width/2.0)
#print height/3
#If you want to keep the decimal point make sure the values are floating point before division is carried out.
#and to round off the int() is a good idea
#print int (10/3) This should be 3.3 and int returns 3, which is fine
#print int (8/3) This should return 2.66.. but instead this returns 2. int ignores the decimal part, and does NOT round it off.
